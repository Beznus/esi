    E-Sports Initiative is a nonprofit organization that strives to galvanize recreational and competitive video game players, as well as the gaming industry, to raise money for local causes. We work to beneficially impact the community while maintaining a positive image of the industry and its consumers.

	The goal of ESI is to empower local Columbus-area students to study STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math)-related fields, and to enrich the educational experience of these students by directly funding affiliated programs.
